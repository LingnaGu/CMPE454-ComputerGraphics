Known Isses:
- Ship can't rotate past the starting position in either direction.
	- I tried implementing a workaround in RotateCW and RotateCCW to econgize and wrap around at this point but the ship disappears sometimes.
	- I understand we were supposed to modify RotateCW but I spoke with other people that didn't modify this function and they didn't have this issue.
